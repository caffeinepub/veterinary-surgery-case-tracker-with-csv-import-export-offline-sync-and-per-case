    "Case-loading logic is implemented in frontend hooks (e.g., hooks/useQueries.ts or hooks/useBackendConnection.ts) which call backend queries.",
    "Although case-loading hooks appear updated, a deprecated backend call path may still exist in a UI component (likely `CaseList.tsx`) rather than in hooks."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Live app web page shows 'Server Cases Loading Failed' when loading cases; likely caused by frontend still calling deprecated backend query getAllSurgeryCases from case-loading hooks.",
    "Live production site still shows 'Server Cases Loading Failed'; likely due to a remaining `getAllSurgeryCases()` call in a component (suspected `CaseList.tsx`) despite hooks being cleaned."

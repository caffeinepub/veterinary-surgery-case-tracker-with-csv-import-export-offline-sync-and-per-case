  "summary": "The diff only updates project_state.json to record the requested work items as pending. No frontend code, hooks, generated backend bindings, or deployment documentation/scripts were changed, so the BuildRequest requirements are not implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Audit all frontend case-loading hooks and flows to ensure there are zero runtime call paths that invoke deprecated backend method getAllSurgeryCases(), and update remaining references to use paginated API getSurgeryCases(start, limit).",
      "reason": "No changes were made to any frontend/src code or hooks; only project_state.json was modified and it marks this work as pending, so there is no evidence that getAllSurgeryCases references/call paths were removed or replaced with getSurgeryCases pagination.",

        "project_state.json"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the deployed frontend is using fresh generated backend bindings and is redeployed so Live cannot call removed legacy APIs.",
      "reason": "No generated declaration files (e.g., frontend/src/declarations/backend/backend.did.d.ts) or redeploy steps/scripts were modified; only project_state.json was updated and indicates this is pending.",

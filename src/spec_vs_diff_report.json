  "summary": "The diff only modifies `project_state.json` and does not implement any frontend code changes or regenerated backend TypeScript bindings required to remove `getAllSurgeryCases()` call paths or update declarations.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Ensure `frontend/src/components/cases/CaseList.tsx` and its dependent case-loading flows have zero runtime call paths invoking deprecated `getAllSurgeryCases()`, replacing with paginated `getSurgeryCases(start, limit)` via existing store/query path.",
      "reason": "No frontend source files were changed; the only modification is to `project_state.json`, so there is no evidence that `CaseList.tsx` or related hooks/stores were updated to remove `getAllSurgeryCases()` usage.",

        "project_state.json"

      "requirement": "Rebuild/redeploy the Live frontend using freshly generated backend TypeScript bindings and confirm `frontend/src/declarations/backend/backend.did.d.ts` does not include `getAllSurgeryCases`.",
      "reason": "No generated declarations or build/binding artifacts were modified; only `project_state.json` changed, so there is no evidence of refreshed bindings or removal of `getAllSurgeryCases` from `backend.did.d.ts`.",

      "description": "Added/updated internal project tracking entries (AR-1..AR-5) in `project_state.json`, including incorrect mappings to non-existent requirement IDs (REQ-1/REQ-2) and pending audit tasks.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks to fix frontend case-loading and regenerate bindings; it does not request changes to `project_state.json` or creation of audit-request metadata.",

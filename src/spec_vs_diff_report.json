  "summary": "Diff implements deterministic clean rebuild and redeploy scripting, including checks for regenerated bindings and absence of the legacy getAllSurgeryCases reference. However, it also includes many unrelated frontend feature/code changes that go beyond the requested deployment/binding fix scope.",

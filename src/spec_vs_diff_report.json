  "summary": "Diff appears to implement the requested Quick Add Demographics fixes: paste handling captures text synchronously and triggers extraction, extraction rules are expanded (MRN formats, names with mixed case and punctuation), and CaseForm is described as providing toast feedback for both no-detection and success counts. Some key CaseForm logic is truncated, so verification of touched-fields protection and toast behavior relies partly on file summary text.",
